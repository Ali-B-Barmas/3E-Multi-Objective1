# 3E-Multi-Objective1
3E Analysis of a Multi-Objective Cycle Integrating Solar and Thermoelectric Systems, completed in January 2023.

This project involves conducting a 3E (Energy, Exergy, Economic) Analysis of a multi-objective cycle integrating a solar collector, thermoelectric systems, and other components using MATLAB. The cycle includes coupling of Rankine, Vapor Compression, and Brayton cycles for combined power and refrigeration applications.

Overview:

    Key aspects of the project:
    * Conducted Energy, Exergy, and Economic (3E) analysis of a multi-objective cycle.
    * Integrated a solar collector and thermoelectric generator into the system.
    * Coupled with Rankine, Vapor Compression, and Brayton cycles.
    * The project validates the paper:
      Proposal of a new parabolic solar collector assisted power-refrigeration system integrated with thermoelectric generator using 3E analyses: Energy, exergy,   
      and exergo-economic

    * Props used for thermophysical properties of working fluids.
    
Features:
    * Validates a comprehensive 3E analysis from a published research paper.
    * Models power and refrigeration systems integrating solar and thermoelectric components.
    * Simulates the thermodynamic performance of multiple cycles using MATLAB.
